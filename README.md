# My Weather App
This web app allows the user to search for a location and view the current weather, as well as the weather forecast for the next five days, at that location.
## Motivation
This project was created as a way for me to practice working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is also the first project I worked on that uses APIs. Making this project allowed me to learn more about APIs and how they can be used to make my projects more complex.
## Features
- Search for locations
- View current weather condition
- View current, feels-like, maximum, and minimum temperatures
- Five day weather forecast
- Responsive to screen size
- Cool background map
